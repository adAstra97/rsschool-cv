## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

I was always really attracted to doing something that was simultaneously connected with logic, computer and visual. And I found all this in frontend development.

I recently completed certified courses in this area. And I can say with confidence that I would like to connect my professional career with this area.

I am currently involved in a startup developing a leisure application as a front-end developer.

My _strengths_ include:
* curiosity and desire for self-development, not a single interesting article or video will pass me by;
* perseverance and focus on completing assigned tasks;
* I don‚Äôt put off until tomorrow what I can do today.
